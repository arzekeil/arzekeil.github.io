Hey everyone! I'm Arzekeil De Leon, and I'm on my way to becoming a Cloud and DevOps Engineer. I get really excited about building things, especially when it involves making IT infrastructure more efficient and reliable. My journey through Computer Science at Wilfrid Laurier University and my work experiences have shaped my path, and I'm keen to share a bit about it.

## Where I've Been

University gave me the foundation, but it's been the hands-on stuff that's really made it click. I've been lucky to explore a few different areas in IT, and each has taught me something valuable:

* **Cloud & DevOps at TD Bank:** This is where I truly caught the cloud bug. Migrating apps to Azure, automating processes with Terraform and scripts â€“ it was like solving a giant puzzle, and I loved it! Seeing how much time and effort we could save by automating things was a huge motivator.
* **Site Reliability at Kinaxis:** Getting into Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) was eye-opening. It's all about keeping systems running smoothly, and I learned a ton about monitoring performance and making sure everything stays stable.
* **Quality Engineering:** Spending time in QA roles at TD Bank and Knowledge First Financial (Embark) taught me the importance of paying attention to detail and making sure software actually *works* the way it's supposed to. No one likes buggy code!
* **IT Support:** Even my time doing IT support at university helped me understand how important it is to be able to troubleshoot problems and communicate clearly with people.

## What I Love to Work With

I've picked up a few skills along the way, and I'm always adding to the list:

* **Cloud:** Azure is my playground right now.
* **Automation:** I'm a big fan of scripting with Python, Bash, and PowerShell to make life easier.
* **Infrastructure:** Terraform is my go-to for managing infrastructure as code.
* **Containers:** Docker is super useful, and I've been using it in my home lab.

## Where I'm Headed

Looking ahead, I'm laser-focused on Cloud and DevOps. What really gets me pumped is:

* **Building Scalable Systems:** Designing cloud stuff that can handle anything you throw at it.
* **Automating Everything:** Creating pipelines that deploy code without any hiccups.
* **Making Things Efficient:** Finding ways to cut down on wasted time and resources.

I'm always up for a challenge and excited to keep learning. If you're into cloud tech and DevOps, I'd love to connect!
